Problem Statement
=========================================
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing service, has experienced a significant decline in revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this challenge and ensure future growth post-lockdown, the company aims to understand the demand for shared bikes in the American market. BoomBikes has enlisted a consulting firm to identify the key factors influencing bike demand and how well these factors predict demand. They have collected an extensive dataset on daily bike demand, influenced by meteorological surveys and user behavior, to prepare for the market's resurgence and outpace competitors.

Model Details
=========================================	
Following are the steps performed to develop the linear regression model:
	
	- 1. Importing the required Python library
	- 2. Reading, understanding, cleaning & visualizing the data
		- dropped these fields- 'registered', 'casual', 'dteday', 'instant'.
		- Correct the names from 0,1 to summer/sprint/Jan/Fab etc
		- EDA & added some findings
	- 3. Preparing the data for modelling (train- test split, rescaling)
	- 4. Model Generation
	- 5. Residual Analysis
	- 6. Prediction & evaluation of the test set
	- 7. Model Evaluation
	- 8. R2 Score - 0.8074
